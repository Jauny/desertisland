This is a little game that I made to work on my if-statement, and other concept…

This is the Exercise 26 of Learn Ruby the Hard Way from Zed. A. Shaw and Rob Sobers.

Thanks for the good book!

Hope the game works well.

Tried to work also on my Arrays, so I used an array to keep track of the answers given to then give the path used by the player after a win or a loss.

Enjoy :)

(PS: I am learning, so it might (should… must?!) be shitty!)
